# CI CD Template
goals of this project are next
1. helps to setup typescript jest npm project
2. configure ci/cd to build and publish npm packages
3. configure linters (remote,local)
4. configure tests (remote, local)
5. help to configure local enviroment to access npm gitlab registry
6. configure build platforms(ex:netlify) to access npm gitlab registry

There are at least 2 types of projects:
1. libraries/components imported by other projects. this projects should just be pushed to npm registry.
2. apps delivered to clients. this projects should be distributed via servers(ex:cdn, nginx server).
